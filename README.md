# Student Performance Indicator

Predict student success using machine learning models and deploy as an interactive web app on Microsoft Azure.

## Overview

This project aims to provide valuable insights into student performance by leveraging various machine learning models. Users can input key details, and the predictive models analyze the data to forecast a student's potential performance in mathematics. The project includes the development of an interactive web app using Flask and successful deployment on Microsoft Azure.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Implemented scikit-learn models, including linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and decision trees.
  - Utilized the power of machine learning for accurate predictions.

- **Web App Development:**
  - Developed an interactive web application using Flask.
  - Designed a clean and minimalist user interface for a seamless experience.

- **Deployment:**
  - Successfully deployed the project on Microsoft Azure.
  - Ensured scalability and reliability for users accessing the platform.
